	$articleBody = '<p>"New York City and Chicago were in chaos. And what happened with them  was happening in all the large cities. A third of the New York police  were dead. Their chief was also dead, likewise the mayor. All law and  order had ceased. The bodies were lying in the streets un-buried. All  railroads and vessels carrying food and such things into the great  city had ceased runnings and mobs of the hungry poor were pillaging  the stores and warehouses. Murder and robbery and drunkenness were  everywhere. Already the people had fled from the city by millions&mdash;at  first the rich, in their private motor-cars and dirigibles, and then the  great mass of the population, on foot, carrying the plague with them,  themselves starving and pillaging the farmers and all the towns and  villages on the way.</p>
	
	<blockquote>"The man who sent this news, the wireless operator, was alone with his  instrument on the top of a lofty building. The people remaining in the  city&mdash;he estimated them at several hundred thousand&mdash;had gone mad from  fear and drink, and on all sides of him great fires were raging. He was  a hero, that man who staid by his post&mdash;an obscure newspaperman, most  likely.</blockquote>

	<p>"For twenty-four hours, he said, no transatlantic airships had arrived,  and no more messages were coming from England. He did state, though,  that a message from Berlin&mdash;that\'s in Germany&mdash;announced that Hoffmeyer,  a bacteriologist of the Metchnikoff School, had discovered the serum for  the plague. That was the last word, to this day, that we of America  ever received from Europe. If Hoffmeyer discovered the serum, it was too  late, or otherwise, long ere this, explorers from Europe would have  come looking for us. We can only conclude that what happened in America  happened in Europe, and that, at the best, some several score may have  survived the Scarlet Death on that whole continent.</p>

	<blockquote>"For one day longer the despatches continued to come from New York.  Then they, too, ceased. The man who had sent them, perched in his lofty  building, had either died of the plague or been consumed in the great  conflagrations he had described as raging around him. And what had  occurred in New York had been duplicated in all the other cities. </blockquote>

	<p>"Hundreds of these airships escaped to Hawaii, and not only did they  bring the plague with them, but they found the plague already there  before them. This we learned, by the despatches, until all order in San  Francisco vanished, and there were no operators left at their posts to  receive or send. It was amazing, astounding, this loss of communication  with the world. It was exactly as if the world had ceased, been blotted  out. For sixty years that world has no longer existed for me. I know  there must be such places as New York, Europe, Asia, and Africa; but not  one word has been heard of them&mdash;not in sixty years. With the coming of  the Scarlet Death the world fell apart, absolutely, irretrievably. Ten  thousand years of culture and civilization passed in the twinkling of an  eye, \'lapsed like foam.\'</p>

	<p>"I was telling about the airships of the rich. They carried the plague  with them and no matter where they fled, they died. I never encountered  but one survivor of any of them&mdash;Mungerson. He was afterwards a Santa  Rosan, and he married my eldest daughter. He came into the tribe eight  years after the plague. He was then nineteen years old, and he was  compelled to wait twelve years more before he could marry. You see,  there were no unmarried women, and some of the older daughters of the  Santa Rosans were already bespoken. So he was forced to wait until  my Mary had grown to sixteen years. It was his son, Gimp-Leg, who was  killed last year by the mountain lion.</p>

	<p>"Mungerson was eleven years old at the time of the plague. His father  was one of the Industrial Magnates, a very wealthy, powerful man. It was  on his airship, the Condor, that they were fleeing, with all the family,  for the wilds of British Columbia, which is far to the north of here.  But there was some accident, and they were wrecked near Mount Shasta.  You have heard of that mountain. It is far to the north. The plague  broke out amongst them, and this boy of eleven was the only survivor.  For eight years he was alone, wandering over a deserted land and looking  vainly for his own kind. And at last, travelling south, he picked up  with us, the Santa Rosans.</p>';
